# MeowScript
 MSC is an EsoLang

## Overview
The MSC Interpreter is a simple command-line tool written in C that interprets a programming language known as MSC. MSC is a language with a syntax inspired by the sounds made by cats: "meow," "hiss," and "purr."

## Usage
To use the MSC Interpreter, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Interpreter:**
   You can download the MSC Interpreter for Windows [here](https://git.dev.rahcode.com/MeowScript/releases/latest)

2. **Run a MSC Program:**
   ```bash
   .\meowscript.exe <filename.meow>
   ```

   Replace `<filename.meow>` with the path to your MSC program file.

## MSC Syntax
MSC consists of three commands:

- **meow:** Increments the ASCII value.
- **hiss:** Decrements the ASCII value.
- **purr:** Outputs the ASCII character.

### Example MSC Program
```meowscript
meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow
meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow
meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow
meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow
meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow
meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow
meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow
meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow
meow hiss meow purr
```
This program increments the ASCII value 65 times, decrements it once, increments it once, and then outputs the corresponding ASCII character `A`.

## Building from Source
If you want to build the MSC Interpreter from source, make sure you have a C compiler installed. Use the following commands:

```bash
make
```
